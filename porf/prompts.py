2. ARTICLE OUTLINE — as many sections as the topic requires, each with a specific
   CLAIM grounded in the findings. Claims should be arguable — something an expert
   could attack or defend with evidence.

   - Each section should have ONE focused claim. If a section covers multiple
     distinct aspects, give it subsections with their own focused sub-claims
   - Prefer granular sections over broad ones — a section trying to do too much

ANTI_PATTERNS = """\
AVOID these patterns (in whatever language you write):
- Inflated importance: words that exaggerate significance without adding meaning
- Mechanical transitions: formal conjunctive adverbs between paragraphs \
(the equivalent of "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally")
- Hedging: phrases like "It's important to note", "It's worth mentioning"
- Hollow academic filler: -ing gerunds that sound analytical but say nothing \
("highlighting", "emphasizing", "showcasing")
- Negative parallelism: "It's not just X, it's Y" contrast constructions
- Promotional tone: travel-brochure language about "rich traditions" and "vibrant culture"
- Vague attribution: "experts say", "studies show" without specifics
- Formulaic structure: bullet lists with bold headers inside prose sections
- Bookend clichés: "In conclusion", "As we have seen", "In the realm of"
- Repetitive section endings: ending every section with a rhetorical question \
(vary endings: some with images, some with statements, some with questions)
- Monotonous section openings: using the same transition structure to bridge \
every section (e.g., always echoing the previous ending with "but..." or \
"however..."). Vary: sometimes echo, sometimes cut to a new scene, sometimes \
jump in time, sometimes start with a concrete detail that connects thematically \
without any explicit verbal bridge.
"""

PROSE_TECHNIQUES = """\
MANDATORY prose techniques:
- Use contractions natural for the language (don't/won't in EN, etc.)
- Vary sentence length dramatically: short fragments for punch, long compounds for depth
- Open sections with a concrete scene, fact, or anecdote — NEVER a thesis statement
- Active voice wherever possible
- Prefer short common words over formal/Latinate equivalents
- Occasional sentence fragments. For rhythm.
- Specific numbers, names, dates over vague claims
- Weave citations into flowing prose — never interrupt narrative to block-quote
- Transition between sections through narrative flow, not conjunctions — and \
never use the same transition technique twice in a row
- One-sentence paragraphs for emphasis, mixed with multi-sentence paragraphs
- Take positions — don't hedge everything with qualifiers
